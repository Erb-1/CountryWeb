First time using an API to import data and use it to create a dynamic table. Was done as part of an assignment for University.
It definitely isn't perfect, the search bar isnt 100% working but it's a good first attempt and will work on a version 2.

The task was to correctly import the API that gives you the regions and country data, put it into a dynamic table and have all of the code in one HTML
document which is ugly but it was required.
